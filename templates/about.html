<p>We make sharing media easy and fast. We also do some fancy tricks like converting GIFs to HTML5 video so that
they load even faster:</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="left">
        <h3>Before MediaCrush</h3>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='demo.gif') }}" alt="GIF demo">
        <p>Filesize: 1965 kB (~2.0 MB)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="middle">
        Result:<br>
        <strong>1600% faster</strong><br>
        <a href="/">Try it yourself!</a>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <h3>After MediaCrush</h3>
        <iframe src="https://mediacru.sh/sSjUfGQLO7zc/frame" frameborder="0" allowFullscreen width="384" height="221"></iframe>
        <p>Filesize: 118 kB (~0.118 MB)</p>

<h2>Is it free?</h2>
<p>Yes, always and forever. We will never charge for our services, you'll be able to host your media easily and
in high quality on MediaCrush until the end of time. Plus, we're free as in freedom, too. MediaCrush is
<a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush">totally open source</a>, under the MIT license. You're welcome
to run your own version of MediaCrush or contribute new ideas to ours.</p>
<h2>How do you feel about privacy?</h2>
<p>Very serious. More so than a lot of people. We take lots of steps to ensure you're protected - note that you're
reading this over HTTPS, for one. We never ever store anything about you when you use our service. We also respect
your Do Not Track settings. You can donate anonymously to our efforts with bitcoin, and we don't show any ads with
nasty tracking code. Also, if you're wondering what we're up to, we publish
<a href="/transparency">detailed reports</a> on what we're doing every month.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Warning: technical jargon ahead. When you upload a file to MediaCrush, it enters our "processing pipeline". We
use a bunch of great open-source tools to work our magic. The job is queued up with Celery and any of our spare
processing servers can pick it up and get to work. We detect what the file is with tools like ffprobe and ImageMagick,
and send it off to the appropriate processing tools. Videos (and GIFs) are processed with ffmpeg, and so is audio.
We have a few specific tools for images, but most just go through ImageMagick and get converted into something we
can display in your web browser. You can check it all out
<a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush">at our GitHub repository</a>, and even help improve it!</p>
<h2>How do I keep in touch?</h2>
<p>We announce new features and respond to user feedback from our <a href="https://twitter.com/mediacru_sh">Twitter
account</a>, and write about them on our <a href="https://blog.mediacru.sh">blog</a>. You can also get in touch
through <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/mediacrush">/r/mediacrush</a>, or
<a href="mailto:support@mediacru.sh">email us</a>. Developers are invited to join us on our IRC channel,
<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mediacrush&uio=d4">#mediacrush on irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<h2>Have you got any apps?</h2>
<p>Yes, of course! We want to make it as easy as possible to use MediaCrush. Check out our <a href="/apps">apps</a>
page to see what we've got. There's a Windows app, a mobile site, browser plugins, and a bash script, plus anything
else we might have added since this text here was written. You can also check out our <a href="/docs">API</a> and
work on your own! Let us know if you've done one and we'll promote it on our apps page.</p>
<h2>What's the upload limit?</h2>
<p>A very generous <strong>50 MB</strong>! Upload as much as you like!</p>
<h2>Can I hotlink to MediaCrush?</h2>
<p>What use is media hosting if you can't share your files with it? You can hotlink to our images,
but you might have a problem hotlinking to GIFs, video, or music, due to technical limitations. Never fear, though:
we have prepared a iframe-based solution that gives you some HTML to paste into your blog or website or whatever.
Just click "embed" on the page you want to embed and you'll get the code. Programmers may also want to browse our
<a href="/docs">developer documentation</a>. If you want to direct link in Reddit, though, don't worry about it -
MediaCrush is RES-compatible and it'll work out anyway.</p>

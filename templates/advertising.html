<h1>Ads on MediaCrush</h1>
<p>This page compliments our overall <a href="/serious">privacy policy and terms of use</a>.</p>
<p>MediaCrush has optional advertising to help cover our costs. There are a few important things you might want to know about.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We publish all of our finances on our <a href="https://blog.mediacru.sh">blog</a></li>
    {% if ads %}
    <li>You can <a href="#" class="ad-opt-out">opt-out</a> &mdash; you are currently <strong><span class="ad-state">opted in</span></strong></li>
    {% else %}
    {% if g.do_not_track %}
    <li>You are <strong>opted-out</strong> and you cannot opt back in because you have Do Not Track set</li>
    {% else %}
    <li>You can <a href="#" class="ad-opt-out">opt-in</a> &mdash; you are currently <strong><span class="ad-state">opted out</span></strong></li>
    {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
</ul>
<p>We use <a href="https://www.projectwonderful.com">Project Wonderful</a> for advertising. It took us a long time to find an
advertiser that met our needs for user privacy and had a general do-good attitude. They have an excellent <a href="https://www.projectwonderful.com/privacypolicy.php">privacy policy</a>,
and we're glad to have finally found them. They don't track you and they have a great relationship with open software and creative commons.</p>
<p>All of that being said, we still will not show you ads if you have <a href="http://donottrack.us/">Do Not Track</a> set. Project Wonderful is a third party, which means that
we cannot entirely control how they may or may not track you. If you do not use Do Not Track and you are concerned about this, you
are advised to opt-out of advertising.</p>
<h2>How do I advertise on MediaCrush?</h2>
<p>You can bid on ads with <a href="https://www.projectwonderful.com/advertisehere.php?id={{ ad_id }}&type=5&_r=">Project Wonderful</a>. If you're an open-source project or you feel like you're particularly
in-line with the MediaCrush way, <a href="mailto:admin@mediacru.sh">drop us a line</a> and tell us about yourself. We'll consider
showing some ads for you for free.</p>
<h2>I hate ads but I want to support MediaCrush!</h2>
<p>No worries! You can <a href="/donate">donate</a> to the cause. You can also just keep on using the site with ads disabled - we won't be upset.</p>
<h2>I run my own MediaCrush instance, how do I advertise?</h2>
<p>To those who don't understand this question: MediaCrush is <a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush">open-source</a>. This means that
any sysadmin with sufficient skill can host their own version of MediaCrush, or contribute features to ours. If you do so, and you'd like to enable
advertising, please submit an application to Project Wonderful, then fill out the relevant details in <code>config.ini</code>. Ask about any
problems you run into on the mailing list.</p>

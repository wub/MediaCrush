<p>There are a number of ways to make it a little easier to use MediaCrush. Here are the official ways:</p>
<h3>Web Browsers</h3>
<p>We've made a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mediacrush/efbojpedpjjpppahkknegfblpdliiple" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a>
and a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mediacrush/" target="_blank">Firefox add-on</a> that lets you upload images on the
web straight to MediaCrush.  Give them a try!</p>
<h3>Mobile</h3>
<p>Using MediaCrush on the go is as simple as can be &mdash; just head over to <a href="/">https://mediacru.sh</a>
from your mobile device to use our mobile site.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Using Windows? <a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush-Windows/releases/download/1.0.0/MediaCrush.exe">Download</a> the official MediaCrush
Windows application. You can upload files straight from your desktop and send screenshots directly to MediaCrush. And of course, it's
<a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush-Windows">open source</a>.</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>For Linux users, we have <a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush-cli">MediaCrush-cli</a>, which allows you to upload media from the comfort
of your favorite shell. Arch Linux users can install it via the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mediacrush-cli/">AUR package</a>, and
Gentoo users can get it through the <a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/package/app-misc/mediacrush-cli">portage package</a>.</p>
<h3>Everyone Else</h3>
We're still working on more ways to use MediaCrush on your system. Want it faster? Have a look at our
straightforward <a href="/docs">API</a> and see if you can make your own!</p>
<h3>Third party apps</h3>
<p>There are also a number of third party apps with MediaCrush support. <a href="mailto:support@mediacru.sh">Have you written one?</a></p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://screengrab.doomer.org/">ScreenGrab</a> lets you take screenshots and upload them, on Linux and Windows</li>
    <li><a href="http://redditenhancementsuite.com/">Reddit Enhancement Suite</a> can display MediaCrush links inline on Reddit</li>
